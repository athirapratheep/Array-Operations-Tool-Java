A simple and efficient Matrix Calculator built in Java that allows users to perform various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and symmetry check. This project is designed to handle basic matrix computations interactively through a menu-driven program.

Features::

Matrix Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.

Matrix Subtraction: Subtract one matrix from another of the same dimensions.

Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

Transpose of a Matrix: Generate the transpose of a given matrix.

Symmetry Check: Verify whether a matrix is symmetric or not.

Menu-driven Interface: Easy-to-use interface that guides users through the operations step-by-step.

How It Works::

The program accepts user inputs for matrices, validates the dimensions, and performs the selected operation. Each operation is implemented in a modular way for better readability and maintainability.

Matrix Addition:

Reads two matrices of the same dimensions.

Adds corresponding elements of the matrices.

Matrix Subtraction:

Reads two matrices of the same dimensions.

Subtracts corresponding elements of the second matrix from the first matrix.

Matrix Multiplication:

Validates the dimensions of the matrices to ensure compatibility.

Computes the product of two matrices using the standard multiplication algorithm.

Transpose:

Flips a matrix over its diagonal, exchanging rows and columns.

Symmetry Check:

Compares each element  with  to determine if the matrix is symmetric.
